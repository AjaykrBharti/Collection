# Collection
I have developed collections of Apps with definte application. 
For example adding image, checking grammar, accounts, to-do list and so on.

3. Specify the URL of the repository that you want to clone. In this case paste "https://github.com/AjaykrBharti/Collection.git".
4. In the Directory, select the folder where you want to save the project.
