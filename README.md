# Collection
I have developed collections of Apps with definte application. 
For example adding image, checking grammar, accounts, to-do list and so on. 

To import these codes use below command:

git clone https://github.com/AjaykrBharti/Collection.git


Steps to import this in Pycharm:

1. Choose VCS | Get from Version Control.
2. Get from Version Control dialog, choose GitHub on the left.
3. Specify the URL of the repository that you want to clone. In this case paste "https://github.com/AjaykrBharti/Collection.git".
4. In the Directory, select the folder where you want to save the project.
5. Click Clone. If you want to create a project based on these sources, click Yes in the confirmation dialog.


Command need to execute once you have setup everything in place. Like virtual environment and django has been installed.  

1. Go to requirements.txt file location and execute pip install -r requirements.txt
   Once you will hit enter it will start installing all the required files.
   
2.
